# Hey there👋 I'm Diya !

## About Me 💁‍♀️
I’m diving into the world of **Web Development** with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, plus some fun with **Bootstrap** and **React**. I’ve also dabbled in **C++**, but right now, it’s all about the web!

When I’m *not* coding, you’ll find me:
- 💃 **Dancing like no one’s watching** – it’s my ultimate happy place.
- 🎶 **Jamming to 80s & 90s Bollywood** – golden tunes for the soul.
- ✈️ **Exploring new places** – New places, new cultures, new experiences , I’m here for all of it.
- 🍲 **Cooking up experiments** in the kitchen (some actually taste good!).
- 🎙️ **Soaking up podcasts** – always learning something random and cool.

### Let’s Connect! 🌟
Whether it’s tech talk, travel tips, or sharing a favorite playlist, I’m here for it. Thanks for stopping by, and have an awesome day! 😊
